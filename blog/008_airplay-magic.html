    <p class="byline">Posted by Jason Rhodes on October 23rd, 2015</p>
    <div class="container post-container"><p>I bought an Apple TV for my living room when we cut DirecTV earlier this year, but the AirPlay mirroring feature never worked. Today, I finally discovered why, kind of, or at least how to fix it, I think.</p>
<p>If you have AirPlay problems where you can&#39;t seem to ever connect, or if you do it lags horribly and disconnects, sometimes knocking out your entire Wi-Fi, try this. Log into your wireless router. I have a Cisco/LinkSys E2500, but I think this is a problem for many kinds of routers. I logged into mine at <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>, but if that doesn&#39;t work for you, Google for the brand of your router and &quot;IP address&quot; to get some other suggestions to try.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re logged in, you&#39;ll need to find a setting called &quot;WMM&quot; or &quot;WiFi Multimedia&quot; support. Fair warning, this setting is <em>supposed</em> to make streaming easier and more reliable, so disabling it could cause you other problems if you stream on other devices like a PlayStation, XBox, etc. For iOS devices, laptops, and Apple TVs, this setting made me feel sad.</p>
<p>I found it under <em>Applications &amp; Gaming</em> &gt; <em>QOS</em> and no, I have no idea what these settings are all about. I set WMM to disabled like so:</p>

<p>and ... ta da! I could use AirPlay. That&#39;s my whole story.</p>
