    <h1 class="post-title">Deploy apps with 'git push' using Dokku and Digital Ocean</h1>
    <p class="byline">Posted by Jason Rhodes on April 1st, 2016</p>
    <div class="container post-container"><p>I really like Heroku. I know some developers aren&#39;t big fans (&quot;that sounds nice, but I like to have more control anyway&quot;), but it has worked great for me for little apps like Slack bots or Twitter bots or tiny things I need to ping once in a while. The greatest thing about Heroku apps is that I can deploy them with a simple <code>git push heroku master</code>, watch a ton of logs pour out, and my new code is pushed, dependecies in place, and services restarted.</p>
<p>Recently, Heroku started enforcing its &quot;6 hours of sleep per day&quot; rule for free apps. All apps get put to bed for 6 hours a day, unless you upgrade to the $7/mo plan, which you have to pay per dyno (so per app at least). To be clear, I think this is fair and I think the pricing is fair, but for little hobby shit I just couldn&#39;t justify paying a fee per app like that.</p>
<p>For what I do, I much prefer giving Digital Ocean $10-20 bucks per month and being able to shove as much as I can fit on one of their boxes. But with DO, I have to figure out how to deploy my code there. UGGGH life is really hard. I was going to try to write some git hook magic myself today when my waffley pal <a href="https://twitter.com/visnup">Visnup</a> said, &quot;Dokku sounds close to what you want.&quot; That was at 6:04PM, and I had never heard of Dokku. It&#39;s now 9:48PM later that day and I have a working instance running with a test app deployed. Here&#39;s what I did.</p>
<h2 id="digital-ocean">Digital Ocean</h2>
<p>Since I&#39;d already decided to use Digital Ocean, my first step was to spin up a droplet. If you&#39;re not familiar with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, they&#39;re a great service that provides cloud servers for a monthly fee. <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=dokku">They even have a Dokku image</a>, which I happily grabbed.</p>
<div class="linked-image image-small"><br><a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=dokku"><img src="/assets/images/do-dokku-droplet.png" alt="Dokku on Digital Ocean"></a><br></div>

<p>After picking the image, you pick a size (I grabbed the 512 MB RAM / 20 GB HD for $5/mo just to start), a datacenter, and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">add your SSH public key</a>. The last step is to choose an optional hostname for your new droplet. If you want your apps to run on something like <a href="http://123.45.67.8">http://123.45.67.8</a>, then you can leave this alone, but if you have a domain you&#39;d like to use, enter it in the hostname now.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for the DO side. The droplet should get created in under a minute.</p>
<div class="with-caption image-small"><br><img src="/assets/images/dokku-do.gif" alt="Dokku image getting created"><br>Well, maybe not <em>this</em> fast. But it&#39;s fast.<br></div>


<h2 id="dokku">Dokku</h2>
<p>Once I got Dokku installed and running on Digital Ocean, I went to the new box&#39;s IP address in the browser to bring up the Dokku setup screen.</p>
<div class="image-small"><br><img src="/assets/images/dokku-setup-1.png" alt="Dokku setup screen"><br></div>

<p>It imported my public key from the Digital Ocean setup (was a little scary to see that there tbqh), but not my hostname. I think it was supposed to bring the hostname over, but for me I had to add it again. After adding it back, I checked the &quot;Use virtualhost naming for apps&quot; checkbox, and the url preview changed to <code>http://&lt;app-name&gt;.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code>. Clicking &quot;Finish Setup&quot; redirected me to the Dokku documentation page. Great success.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>Since I&#39;d opted to use hostnames instead of the IP for my Dokku apps, I needed to get my DNS set up correctly too. My domains are mostly managed through <a href="http://iwantmyname.com">http://iwantmyname.com</a>, but most domain management services should have a similar interface for managing your DNS records.</p>
<p>After logging in and finding my way to the &quot;Manage DNS Records&quot; page for my rhodesjason.com domain, I added two A records pointed at the IP address of my Dokku server.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/dns-a-records.png" alt="DNS A record set up"></p>
<p><code>mydokku</code> is the main subdomain I chose for all of my dokku apps. I set up that A record to allow me to SSH into the box at <code>&lt;user&gt;@mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code> and to push to the git remote I&#39;ll eventually set up there, too.</p>
<p><code>*.mydokku</code> is the magic wildcard DNS that will make it so dokku can assign all of my apps to <code>&lt;app-name&gt;.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code>.</p>
<p>Since DNS can take some time to &quot;propagate&quot;, I usually check <a href="http://whatsmydns.net">http://whatsmydns.net</a> to keep track of the status. You can use <code>dig</code> on  the command line, too. Once it&#39;s propagated, you can finish setting up Dokku.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-authorization">Deploy authorization</h2>
<p>This part of the setup bit me. I just added my public key to <code>/home/dokku/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> thinking that would give me all the permissions I need to push to the git remotes that Dokku makes, but it didn&#39;t work. Turns out there is <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/user-management/#adding-deploy-users">a special command you need to run to set up the permissions correctly</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jasonrhodes/919516e75daa50faf4ee037f7dbb0645.js"></script>

<p>To be honest, it&#39;s not totally clear to me the point of the <code>USER</code> in that above command. I think just adding your key to the <code>dokku</code> user is enough, unless you have some special deploy user that a tool has to use.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-dokku-app">Creating a new dokku app</h2>
<p>To create the remote repo, you have to log into the box where Dokku is running. This is a one-time setup for each app. Log into the box, then run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">dokku apps:<span class="hljs-keyword">create</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">sample</span>-dokku
</code></pre>
<p>This does 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates the remote repo called <code>sample-dokku</code></li>
<li>Links the app to my subdomain <code>sample-dokku.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deploying-your-local-repo-with-a-simple-git-push">Deploying your local repo with a simple git push</h2>
<p>All I need now is a little nodejs app to test this thing out with. If you&#39;re testing yours, feel free to clone <a href="https://github.com/jasonrhodes/sample-dokku">https://github.com/jasonrhodes/sample-dokku</a> and use that. When you have a git repo ready to go, you just have to add the dokku remote and push it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git remote add dokku dokku<span class="hljs-variable">@mydokku</span>.rhodesjason.<span class="hljs-symbol">com:</span>sample-dokku
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git push dokku master
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is set up right, you&#39;ll see a long stream of output very similar to Heroku&#39;s deploy output:</p>
<pre><code>Counting objects: 5, done.

</code></pre><p>Ta da! The app is deployed to my custom subdomain. Any time I make changes that I want to deploy, I just push to the <code>dokku</code> remote and off they go. Creating new apps just takes a log-in on the remote box to create the app. And if you want to let others push to the remote, just add their keys with the same command used above.</p>
<p>I just started using it but so far it seems like just what I was looking for. Hope it works for you, too!</p>
