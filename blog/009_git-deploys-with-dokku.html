    <h1 class="post-title">Easy Heroku-like git deployments with Dokku and Digital Ocean</h1>
    <p class="byline">Posted by Jason Rhodes on April 1st, 2016</p>
    <div class="container post-container"><p><em>tl;dr I&#39;m gonna explain how I just set up a Digital Ocean server so I can deploy apps to it with <code>git push</code>, and oh btw I accidentally got custom DNS subdomain management (via nginx) because Dokku is p cool.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After publishing, I discovered <a href="#creating-a-new-dokku-app">this step (creating the app remotely)</a> isn&#39;t even necessary. It&#39;s even easier than I thought.</p>
<hr>

<p>I really like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. I know some developers aren&#39;t big fans, but for small hobby apps like bots or side projects, I love it for one main reason:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console">$ git <span class="hljs-keyword">push </span>heroku master
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s all it takes to deploy an app. And since my apps are almost always node.js apps, I can put the startup command in the <code>npm start</code> script inside <code>package.json</code> and that&#39;s all I have to do. Make a change, push to <code>heroku master</code>, it figures out dependencies, restarts the process, proxies to nginx. It&#39;s the best.</p>
<p>The only reason I looked for anything else is because I can&#39;t justify $7 per app when, like I said, these are little shitty hobby apps. I&#39;d rather throw $10-20 at <a href="https://m.do.co/c/4e1fe8fd0656">Digital Ocean</a> every month and be free to cram that box as full as it&#39;ll go with garbage apps and idiot bots. But dammit I want my easy git deployment, too. Waaaaaaaaah.</p>
<p>I was about to take a stab at some git hook magic myself today when at about 6:04 PM my pal <a href="https://twitter.com/visnup">Visnup</a> suggested, &quot;Dokku sounds close to what you want.&quot; I had never heard of <a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku">Dokku</a>. It&#39;s now 9:48 PM and I have a working Dokku instance running and a test app successfully deployed. And it&#39;s only costing me $5/mo for the cloud server and about $10/year for a cheap domain. Here&#39;s what I did.</p>
<h2 id="digital-ocean">Digital Ocean</h2>
<p>Since I&#39;d already decided to use Digital Ocean, my first step was to spin up a droplet. If you&#39;re not familiar, DO is a great service that provides cloud servers for cheap monthly fees (<a href="https://m.do.co/c/4e1fe8fd0656">give me those sweet referral credits</a>). <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=dokku">They even have a Dokku image</a>, which I happily grabbed.</p>
<div class="linked-image image-small"><br><a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?image=dokku"><img src="/assets/images/do-dokku-droplet.png" alt="Dokku on Digital Ocean"></a><br></div>

<p>After picking the image, you pick a size (I grabbed the 512 MB RAM / 20 GB HD for $5/mo just to start), a datacenter, and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">add your SSH public key</a>. You can also choose an optional hostname for your new droplet if you want your apps to run on something other than the dumb IP address URL.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for the Digital Ocean side. The droplet should get created in under a minute.</p>
<div class="with-caption image-small"><br><img src="/assets/images/dokku-do.gif" alt="Dokku image getting created"><br>Well, maybe not <em>this</em> fast. But it&#39;s fast.<br></div>

<h2 id="dokku">Dokku</h2>
<p>Once I got Dokku installed and running on Digital Ocean, I went to the new box&#39;s IP address in the browser to bring up the Dokku setup screen.</p>
<div class="image-small"><br><img src="/assets/images/dokku-setup-1.png" alt="Dokku setup screen"><br></div>

<p>It imported my public key from the Digital Ocean setup (tbqh it was a little scary to see that pop up there), but not my hostname. I think it was supposed to bring the hostname over, but for me I had to add it again, and then check the &quot;Use virtualhost naming for apps&quot; checkbox which made the url preview change to <code>http://&lt;app-name&gt;.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code>. Clicking &quot;Finish Setup&quot; redirected me to the Dokku documentation page. Great success.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>Since I&#39;d opted to use hostnames instead of the IP for my Dokku apps, I needed to get my DNS set up correctly too. My domains are mostly managed through <a href="http://iwantmyname.com">http://iwantmyname.com</a>, but most domain management services should have a similar interface for managing your DNS records.</p>
<p>After logging in and finding my way to the &quot;Manage DNS Records&quot; page for my rhodesjason.com domain, I added two A records pointed at the IP address of my Dokku server.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/dns-a-records.png" alt="DNS A record set up"></p>
<p><code>mydokku</code> is the main subdomain I chose for all of my dokku apps. I set up that A record to allow me to SSH into the box at <code>&lt;user&gt;@mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code> and to push to the git remote I&#39;ll eventually set up there, too.</p>
<p><code>*.mydokku</code> is the magic wildcard DNS that will make it so dokku can assign all of my apps to <code>&lt;app-name&gt;.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code>.</p>
<p>Since DNS can take some time to &quot;propagate&quot;, I usually check <a href="http://whatsmydns.net">http://whatsmydns.net</a> to keep track of the status. You can use <code>dig</code> on  the command line, too. Once it&#39;s propagated, you can finish setting up Dokku.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-authorization">Deploy authorization</h2>
<p>This part of the setup bit me. I just added my public key to <code>/home/dokku/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> thinking that would give me all the permissions I need to push to the git remotes that Dokku makes, but it didn&#39;t work. Turns out there is <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/user-management/#adding-deploy-users">a special command you need to run to set up the permissions correctly</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console"><span class="hljs-comment"># from your local machine</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># replace dokku.me with your domain name or the host's IP</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># replace root with your server's root user</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># USER is the username you use to refer to this particular key</span>
cat ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/id</span>_rsa.pub | ssh root<span class="hljs-variable">@dokku</span>.me <span class="hljs-string">"sudo sshcommand acl-add dokku USER"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To be honest, it&#39;s not totally clear to me the point of the <code>USER</code> in that above command. I think just adding your key to the <code>dokku</code> user is enough, unless you have some special deploy user that a tool has to use.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-dokku-app">Creating a new dokku app</h2>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This step isn&#39;t necessary at all. I just discovered while playing with dokku a bit more that pushing to the remote will create the repo for you if it doesn&#39;t exist, using a tool called <a href="https://github.com/progrium/gitreceive">gitreceive</a>. So it&#39;s even awesomer than I thought. <a href="#deploying-your-local-repo-with-a-simple-git-push">Skip to the next step</a>.</p>
<p>To create the remote repo, you have to log into the box where Dokku is running. This is a one-time setup for each app. Log into the box, then run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console">dokku apps:<span class="hljs-keyword">create</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">sample</span>-dokku
</code></pre>
<p>This does 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates the remote repo called <code>sample-dokku</code></li>
<li>Links the app to my subdomain <code>sample-dokku.mydokku.rhodesjason.com</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deploying-your-local-repo-with-a-simple-git-push">Deploying your local repo with a simple git push</h2>
<p>All I need now is a little app to test this thing out with. As best as I can tell, you can use any language you want, but I threw together <a href="https://github.com/jasonrhodes/sample-dokku">a simple nodejs sample app</a>. If you just want something simple to test with, feel free to <code>git clone git@github.com:jasonrhodes/sample-dokku.git</code>. When you have your local git repo ready to go, you just have to add the dokku remote and push it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git remote add dokku dokku@&lt;your-host-name&gt;<span class="hljs-symbol">:&lt;your-project-name&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git push dokku master
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is set up right, on push you&#39;ll see a long stream of output very similar to Heroku&#39;s deploy output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console">Counting objects: 5, done.

<p>Huzzah, the app is deployed to my custom subdomain. Any time I make changes that I want to deploy, I just push to the <code>dokku</code> remote and off they go. And creating new apps with the same deployment process just takes <del>a quick log in to the remote box to create the app</del> pushing a new git repo to the dokku remote! So far, this is exactly what I wanted. Thanks, @Visnup!</p>
