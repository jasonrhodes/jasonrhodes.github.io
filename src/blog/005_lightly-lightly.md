A friend sent me a quote yesterday and I keep going back to it. 

> It’s dark because you are trying too hard. 
Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. 
>
> Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.
>
> Aldous Huxley

I've always been an intense person in many ways. I squeeze down hard on good times for maximum pleasure extraction and I squeeze equally hard on bad times ... I don't know why? I think maybe to fix them? I'd already been thinking a lot about gentle grips--on friendships, on good feels, on future worry, on anything. 

So then that quote came along and, oh. Yeah, that's exactly it, Aldous. Good job. 

Lightly, lightly. I'll let you know how it goes.
