I used to play with HyperCard a lot during middle school classes and now I write java scripts during basically all the different times.

Some things a person could know:

* I live in Baltimore, MD
* I work for Message Systems, building the [SparkPost](http://sparkpost.com) app
* I write words on twitter as [@rhodesjason](http://twitter.com/rhodesjason)
* I do open sourcey things at [github/jasonrhodes](http://github.com/jasonrhodes)
* I organize [Baltimore NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/baltimore)
* I make educational video series for [tutsplus.com](http://tutsplus.com/authors/jason-rhodes)
* I've given [some talks with slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rhodesjason)

_Did you know "series" is the plural of "series"?_
